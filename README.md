# attendance-system-using-face-detection
This project demonstrates a simple face recognition system using Python and OpenCV. The system captures faces through a webcam, recognizes them using an Eigenfaces model, and logs the recognized faces with their details in an Excel file. It provides real-time feedback by displaying recognized faces and their details on the screen.
